        <h3><em>An easy to remember and hard to forget spicy delicacy!</em>></h3>
        <p>I'm told it's Super Bowl Sunday this weekend and it was therefore suggested to me that
             sharing some kind of party food would be on point. So here's an American game day classic 
             - Jalapeño poppers!! Fresh jalapeños stuffed with a creamy cheesy filling then fried or
              baked, the jalapeño is barely spicy because the spiciness reduces when cooked.</p>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>12 jalapeños</li>
                <li>150g / 5oz streaky bacon</li>
                <li>250g/ 8 oz cream cheese</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup green onion </li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 - 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 cup (100 g) sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 tbsp chives</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Crumbled bacon - </b>Place bacon in a single layer in a large unheated non-stick pan
                     (no oil, Note 2). Turn the stove onto medium high. As the pan heats up, the fat will start to melt.
                      Once sizzling, cook each side for 2 minutes or until golden. Remove onto paper towels to drain the 
                      fat (leave fat in the pan). Repeat with remaining bacon. Once cool and crisp, finely chop into crumbs.</li>
                <li><b>Toast breadcrumbs - </b>Top up the bacon fat with the oil so you have 2 tablespoons in total. Cool 
                    the pan slightly then return to medium heat. Add the breadcrumbs and salt. Toast, stirring regularly,
                     until evenly golden - about 3 minutes. Transfer into a bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li><b>Filling - </b>Put 3/4 of the bacon in a bowl (reserve the rest for topping). Add remaining ingredients
                     then stir with a wooden spoon until combined.</li>
                <li><b>Preheat - </b>oven to 200°C/375°F (180°C fan). Line a tray with foil then place a rack on it (to keep jalapeños level).</li>
                <li><b>Stuff - </b>jalapeños with the filling, slightly above the rim (it sinks a bit) but not too high else there will be overflow. 
                    Place on the rack so the surface is level. Top with the shredded cheese, press down to flatten. Spoon over panko.</li>
                <li><b>Bake - </b>15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and jalapeño is softened but still holding its shape (not saggy).</li>
                <li><b>Transfer - </b>to serving platter, sprinkle with reserved bacon and chives. Serve hot! No dipping sauce needed.</li>
